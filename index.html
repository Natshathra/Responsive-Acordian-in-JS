          <p>
            The primary difference is that HTTPS uses encryption to secure the
            data being transmitted. This encryption is provided by SSL/TLS
            (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), which ensures that
            any data exchanged between the user's browser and the web server is
            encrypted and secure from eavesdroppers.

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            Version control systems (VCS) like Git are tools that help manage
            changes to source code over time. They enable multiple developers to
            collaborate on a project by tracking changes, maintaining different
            versions, and merging code.

          <p>
            A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records
            transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain
            contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block,
            forming a chain.

            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that
            enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance
            over time without being explicitly programmed.
